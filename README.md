# Python_Instacart

## Objectives
Analyze product and order information for Instacart using mock data. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.

##### Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

## Data

.csv files for orders, products and departments.

.pkl files for merged and cleaned datasets with new variables.

## Tools Used

Language - Python

Libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scipy

Software - Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebook, Excel and Google Colaboratory

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Organisaton of project folders, keeping original data and wrangled data separate
2. Keeping scripts annotated and clear for other potential users
3. Data wrangling - dropping/renaming columns, changing variables data type, transposing data and creating new headers
4. Creating data dictionaries and subsetting
5. Data consistency checks - finding and addressing missing values and duplicates
6. Combining and exporting data
7. Joining and merging data
8. Creating new variables with if-statements, .loc function and for-loops
9. Grouping data and aggregating variables
10. Data visualizations - bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, line charts, pie charts
